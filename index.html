  <h2 style="border:2px">Why Coding Makes Sense for a Journalist</h2>
  <p>Having worked as a journalist as well as a photojournalist, I'm looking to make the transition to the coding world. 
 <a href="http://www.cindybaldhoff.com/" target="_blank">Check out my photography site!</a> A journalism background may seem like a strange leap into the world of coding. Actually, it makes sense. 
Instead of writing an interesting story, researching for facts or editing copy before publishing it, I'll be creating code that requires the same sense of accuracy to make great websites.</p>

<div  id="crossfit">
<h2 style="color: green;">Crossfit</h2>

<P>In addition to having a passion to learn to code, I'm also passionate about health and fitness. Crushing grueling Crossfit classes Mon-Fri is my "go-to" 
release for a clear mind and overall wellness. During quarantine when the gyms were closed, our Crossfit box allowed members to borrow some equipment.

As seen in this picture, at no point on this rainy day, did I feel the need in my soul to lift a 40lb dumbbell from the ground to over my head.(lol) 
But with the encouragement of my workout partner, I surprised myself and did it!</p>

<h2 style="color: purple;">Two-stepping in Music City</h2>
<p>Living in Nashville is way too much fun and full of such vibrant music. I've been fortunate to meet Wynnona Judd,

<br/>as well as see the iconic Dolly Parton
performing at a tribute concert with and for Kenny Rogers.
